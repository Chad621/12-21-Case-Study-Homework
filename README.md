Fundrise Case Study
Fundrise

Overview and Origin

According to Crunchbase, Fundrise (the “Company”) was founded in 2010 by Benjamin Miller, Brandon Jenkins, Daniel Miller, and Kenny Shin.  The Company is based in Washington, D.C.   Benjamin and Daniel Miller are the sons of wealthy D.C. real estate developer, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp.  

The Company has completed 7 rounds of funding totaling approximately $56 million with an estimated valuation of $800 million.  Notable investors include Guggenheim Partners and Renren, a Chinese social networking company.  

Business Activities

Fundrise was founded to bring institutional, private-equity type deals to the masses with as little fees as possible.  Traditionally, these type of transactions were inaccessible to the common investor and only reserved for wealthy individuals, private equity and pension funds.  

For as little as $500, investors can participate in a market that was heretofore not available to them.  The Company currently manages $2.5 billion worth of real estate with about $500 million in assets under management and has approximately 93,000 investors.  

When investors sign up, they choose one of three “Core Plans”: Supplemental Income, Balanced Investing, or Long-Term growth.  Each of the plans is a basket of real estate investments (both debt and equity) curated in the form of an eReit and designed to meet each of the three investment criteria.  

Each of the deals that Fundrise offers its investors are underwritten by the Company, beginning with an in-depth screening of the sponsor (i.e. the developer or acquirer) of the deal.  The Company then does due diligence on the project and a detailed financial model (i.e. underwriting) of the transaction.  Finally, if the investment meets the criteria established then, Fundrise will fund the deal before it goes onto the platform.  This is a unique characteristic of Fundrise and some of its competitors.  

According to Stackshare, Fundrise operates in a Java environment.  

Landscape and Results 

Fundrise operates in the Real Estate domain of the FinTech space.  This area seeks to disrupt how traditional real estate finance operates.  As Fundrise’s real estate offerings are considered securities, they are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Traditionally, these investments could only be solicited to accredited investors and only through specific channels.  Recent changes to securities laws, particularly the advent of section 506(c) of Regulation D and Regulation A+, have opened up the ways in which investments may be sought and from whom. Now, investors don’t necessarily need to be accredited (i.e. high net worth individuals) and may be solicited generally (i.e. through advertisements).  

According to IDEAL Real Estate Investing (“IDEAL”), the major players in the Real Estate Fintech space are Fundrise, Equity Multiple, Realty Mogul, Peer Realty, Patch of Land, Acquire Real Estate, and Fund That Flip.  

IDEAL ranked the players across 11 criteria:
1.	Availability – are the services offered across all 50 states?
2.	Prefunding – Does the company prefund the deal before offering it to investors?
3.	Fees – What are the fee sizes and structures?
4.	Minimum investment – The lower the investment minimums the more points the company receives.
5.	Co-investing – Does the company invest alongside its investors and take risk?
6.	Bankruptcy protection – Does the company have a plan in place should they go bankrupt? 
7.	VC funding – Has the crowdfunding company received venture capital funding? 
8.	Non-accredited investors – Does the company offer investments to non-accredited investors?
9.	Diverse property types – Does the company have investments in multiple types of property such as commercial, residential, retail, hotels etc.?
10.	Equity – Does the company offer equity investments? 
11.	Debt – Does the company offer crowdfunded debt investments? 

After applying these criteria, only Fundrise, Realty Mogul and 	Equity Multiple received 5 stars.  Based on these metrics, Fundrise is at the top of its sector.  Although it seems to be paying out on its real estate to investors, the industry is so nascent and has not yet gone through a real estate market correction that it is generally difficult to comment on performance.  

Recommendations

If I were to advise the Company, I would suggest that they have a strategy in place to weather any downturns in the real estate market.  They need to have a strategy for when real estate investments need more capital than anticipated.  Where will these funds come from?  If from new investors, then has the Company created a conflict with existing investors?  

From a technological standpoint, I would suggest that they leverage their Java technology, if possible, into blockchain technology, which may be a more secure and trustworthy way to not only manage investments, but also to provide trustworthy data in the event that real estate investments go awry.  The blockchain’s distributable and immutable properties will allow investors to get comfortable that investments are performing accordingly. When that is not the case, these properties will provide reliable information about the status of the investments and provide a reliable data set from which decisions about the future of the investments could be made.
